I badly needed an appointment for visa. The closest date was in 5 months. Sometimes people reject their booked appointment and it becomes available for everybody. If you are lucky enough you can catch this moment. I am not a lucky person, so I decided to develop special application which checks what is the closest available appointment date.

Every 5 minutes VisaAppointmentChecker checks what is the closest available appointment date. If the closest date is changed, the program sends notification email to you.

If you want to use it:

1) Indicate your personal data and email in application.properties

2) Run integration tests to see if everything works fine

3) Start application and wait for emails :)

This application immediately helped me to discover appointment which was available in 3 days. 5 months versus 3 days. Feel the difference!

Good luck!

PS: I will appreciate any feedback and pull requests.
